BUSINESS CONTEXT:
{context_block}

YOUR GOAL:
This business does not have a website. You want to offer to build them a professional, modern, mobile-friendly website that helps customers find them, builds trust, and grows their business. Tailor the message to their specific business type (e.g. a restaurant needs an online menu and ordering, a salon needs online booking, etc.).

Write exactly three outreach messages for this business. Each must:
- Mention the business by name ("{name}")
- Sound like a real person wrote it — natural, conversational, human
- Be concise (3-5 sentences max)
- Be professional, friendly, and direct
- Mention a specific benefit relevant to their business type (e.g. "customers could see your menu and order online" for a restaurant)
- NOT sound like spam or a mass template
- NOT promise fake audits, made-up statistics, or guaranteed results
- NOT use hype words like "skyrocket", "explosive growth", "dominate"
- NOT be pushy or overly salesy — just a helpful introduction

Format your response EXACTLY like this (keep the labels):

EMAIL:
[Your cold email message here]

CONTACT_FORM:
[Your contact-form message here — slightly shorter and more casual]

DM:
[Your DM message — 2-3 sentences max, very casual and direct]"""
