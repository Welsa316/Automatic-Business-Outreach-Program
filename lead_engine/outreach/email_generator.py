ABOUT THE BUSINESS:
{biz_context}

ABOUT YOU (THE SENDER):
{sender_context}

RULES — follow these exactly:
1. Subject line: Short, specific to their business. No clickbait. No ALL CAPS. No "Quick question" cliches.
2. Opening: Reference something specific about their business (location, reviews, what they do). Do NOT say "I hope this finds you well" or "I came across your business."
3. Body: Explain what you do and why it's relevant to them specifically. Be direct. One short paragraph max.
4. Tone: Professional but warm. Like a real person writing a real email. Not corporate, not salesy.
5. Length: Under 120 words total for the body. Busy professionals won't read more.
6. Closing: Simple call to action. "Would you be open to a quick chat?" or similar. No pressure.
7. Sign-off: Just your name. No "Best regards" or "Warmly" — keep it casual-professional.
8. Do NOT use any of these words/phrases: "leverage", "synergy", "game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "reach out", "touch base", "circle back", "low-hanging fruit", "value proposition", "solutions"
9. Do NOT use emojis.
10. Do NOT include any unsubscribe text — that will be added automatically.

Respond in this exact JSON format (no markdown, no code fences):
{{"subject": "Your subject line here", "body": "Your email body here"}}

The body should include a greeting, the message, and sign-off — all as a single string with \\n for line breaks."""
